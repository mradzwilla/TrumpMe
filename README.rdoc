== Make README's great again

This is a React on Rails app that accurately represents the response of the 55th President to any issue.

Quick summary of how it works:
The app takes user input which is stored in a React state. Clicking the thumbnail tabs loads a corresponding component which is populated with the text. Each template draws to an invisible canvas which is copied to an image tag.
